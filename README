=================

This script is definitely not very easy to set up... but here's some instructions
Note: you'll need a Linux server with PHP5-CLI, postfix installed, and with the ability to send mail.
Also, it's easiest to use this with a gmail account to properly filter your messages.

1) Add a line to your crontab (by using crontab -e) to call:
	/path/to/run.sh
   whenever you want to recieve your email.
2) Add a postfix filter/trigger to push incoming messages to a certain email address to:
	/path/to/process.php
3) Chmod the entire OhJournal folder and your journal.db to give PHP write access.
4) Create the proper database schema. (I forgot to commit a blank one! Will do asap!)
5) ???
6) Create proper tutorial or installation script. (that's a todo for me...)
7) ???
8) Profit!

Apologies for the incomplete installation tutorial and lack of a script yet. That'll be done asap.
