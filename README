This script is definitely not very easy to set up... but here's some instructions
Note: you'll need a Linux server with PHP5-CLI, postfix installed, and with the ability to send mail.
It has been tested on an Ubuntu server, but nothing else.


======	Manual Installation:
1) Add a line to your crontab (by using crontab -e) to call:
	/path/to/run.sh
   whenever you want to recieve your email.
2) Add a postfix filter/trigger to push incoming messages to a certain email address to:
	/path/to/process.php
3) Chmod the entire OhJournal folder and your journal.db to give PHP write access.
7) ???
8) Profit!

======	"Automatic" Installation:
1) Have a Linux system running Postfix with no crazy custom configuration and a domain name.
2) Run ./install.php from command line and hope everything works properly.
3) Visit the non-existent-yet configuration page from the frontend to setup the necessary settings.
	(alternatively, muck around in the "config" database table yourself)
4) ???
5) Profit!

I've made the installer script relatively verbose and easy to read, so if something goes wrong, its changes should be easy to reverse by hand.
An uninstaller script is in the works.
