=================

This script is definitely not very easy to set up... but here's some instructions
Note: you'll need a Linux server with PHP5-CLI installed, and with the ability to send mail.
Also, it's easiest to use this with a gmail account to properly filter your messages.

1) Add a line to your crontab (by using crontab -e) to call:
	/path/to/run.sh
   whenever you want to recieve your email.
   Make sure your server has the correct time zone!

2) Configure mail.php with your email address
3) Set up a Gmail filter to filter all emails coming in from "ohjournalresponse"
	-	I have it set up to archive and mark as read, but you can do whatever you want with them.
4) You're done!



Major todos:
	-	Add web interface
	-	Actually add a reciever for your emails
		-	e.g.: keep the responses local, rather than using your mail inbox as a database
	-	Do a bunch of other cool stuff.
	-	Plenty of work and UI and sexyness!
